"Local login" is an important feature of our product that is designed to increase the security of your assets. In this session, we will explain in detail how this feature works and how to use it.

## 1. The importance of private keys

In the blockchain world, private keys are the key to controlling crypto assets. The private key is equivalent to your digital identity, which is used to sign transactions and prove ownership of assets. Therefore, it is crucial to protect the security of your private key. If your private key is lost or stolen, your assets may be lost forever.

## 2. Local encrypted storage of private keys

## 2.1 Local encrypted storage

To maximize the protection of your private keys, our product uses local encrypted storage. This means that your private keys are securely stored on your device and encrypted with advanced encryption algorithms. The private key is only decrypted when you need to use it to sign a transaction. This approach effectively prevents the private key from being intercepted during network transmission or stolen by malware.

### 2.2 Transaction Signing

When you need to use a private key to sign a transaction, our system will first decrypt the locally stored private key. Then, the front-end will use this private key to sign the transaction, proving that the transaction was initiated by you. The private key is not uploaded to any other location to ensure its security.

## 3. Advantages

There are multiple benefits to using local cryptographic storage of private keys:
- It improves the security of your assets because the private key is stored only on your device and is always encrypted.
- Improves the efficiency of transactions because private key decryption and transaction signing are done locally, eliminating the need for network transmission.
- Increased user privacy because the private key is not uploaded to any server or third party.
