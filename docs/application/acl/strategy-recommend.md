# Strategy Recommendation: AI-Powered Blockchain Account Abstraction Wallet DApps

## 1. Overview

"Strategy Recommendation" is a sophisticated DApp (Decentralized Application) designed for blockchain account abstraction wallets, utilizing artificial intelligence to deliver personalized investment strategies. This application intelligently recommends strategies that align with the user's return expectations by analyzing blockchain strategy performance data.

## 2. Functional Modules

### 2.1 Data Collection

The data collection module is responsible for gathering a wide array of strategy execution data on the blockchain, including:

- Historical performance of trading strategies
- Market volatility indicators
- Records of user asset allocation
- Market sentiment analysis related to strategies
- Real-time transaction flow data

Prior to being fed into the AI model, this data undergoes rigorous cleansing and preprocessing.

### 2.2 Feedback Loop

The feedback loop module is crucial for collecting user feedback on the recommended strategies, which encompasses:

- User satisfaction with strategy recommendations
- Actual investment returns of the recommended strategies
- User feedback on the outcomes of strategy execution

This feedback is vital for the continuous iteration and enhancement of the model.

### 2.3 Strategy Execution

The strategy execution module transforms AI-generated strategy recommendations into concrete execution plans facilitated by the account abstraction wallet, which includes:

- Generation and validation of execution plans
- Automated execution and monitoring of transactions
- Dynamic adjustment and risk control of strategies

The execution plans via the account abstraction wallet ensure seamless and secure execution of recommended strategies within the blockchain ecosystem.

### 2.4 AI Model

The AI model is the heart of the application, encompassing the following steps:

1. **Model Training**: Utilizing vast historical data to train models to discern the intrinsic link between strategies and returns.
2. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance through validation and test sets to ensure predictive robustness.
3. **Model Optimization**: Refining the model based on user feedback to enhance the precision of strategy recommendations.
4. **Recommendation Generation**: Creating personalized investment strategy recommendations based on user-defined return expectations using the trained model.
